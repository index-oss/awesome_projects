## **📌 Overview**
This repository acts as a **central index** for all my work.  
Instead of browsing multiple repos, you can start here and jump directly to any project.  

- **AI & Machine Learning tools** – Real-time anomaly detection, automation, intelligent apps  
- **Cybersecurity projects** – Ethical hacking, server protection, log monitoring  
- **Software & DSA solutions** – Competitive programming patterns and scalable designs
