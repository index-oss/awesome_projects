## **Overview**  
This repository acts as a **central index** for all my work.  
Instead of browsing multiple repos, you can start here and jump directly to any project.  

- **AI & Machine Learning tools** – Real-time anomaly detection, automation, intelligent apps  
- **Cybersecurity projects** – Ethical hacking, server protection, log monitoring  
- **Software & DSA solutions** – Competitive programming patterns and scalable designs  

---

## **How to Navigate**  
- **Each project is listed below with a short description and direct link.**  
- **All projects have their own repositories** with full code, documentation, and usage guides.  
- **This README will always stay up-to-date** as I add or improve projects.  

**Projects:**  
1. **SelfHeal-AI – Autonomous Server Protection**  
2. **SparkVision – Hand Gesture Spark Effects (Web)**  
3. **DSA Patterns Visualizer**
